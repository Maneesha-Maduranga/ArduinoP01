## Soil Moisture Level Monitoring with Arduino
### Introduction
#### In this project, we will be using an Arduino and a soil moisture sensor to measure and monitor the moisture level in the soil. The Arduino will read the sensor data and provide real-time information about the soil moisture level.

## Materials

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Soil moisture sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- USB cable for Arduino
